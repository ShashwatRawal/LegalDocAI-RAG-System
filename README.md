# LegalDocAI: A Generative AI Legal Assistant


## ðŸ“– Overview
LegalDocAI is a full-stack web application designed to demystify complex legal documents. It leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture on Google Cloud to provide users with instant summaries, risk analysis, and an interactive Q&A chat, making dense legal jargon accessible to everyone.

---
##  Key Features
* **Full-Document Analysis:** Uses a **Map-Reduce** pattern to analyze entire documents of any length, generating a comprehensive summary, a list of potential red flags, and a glossary of terms.
* **Trustworthy Q&A:** The interactive chat uses a RAG pipeline to ensure all answers are grounded directly in the source document, eliminating AI hallucinations.
* **Cloud-Native Architecture:** Built on a scalable and resilient stack using Google Cloud's Vertex AI services.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean, user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that guides the user from document upload to final analysis.

---
##  Technology Stack
* **Cloud/AI:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Vertex AI (Gemini, Vector Search, Embeddings)
* **Backend:** Python, `concurrent.futures` for parallel processing
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Core Libraries:** PyMuPDF (`fitz`), LangChain (`for text splitting`)
